- Use `uv add <package_name>` to add package to the project, do not edit the pyproject.toml file manually.
- Use `uv run <script_name>` to run a script and `uvx <tool_name>` to run a python tool on-the-fly.
- Use `uvx pytest` to run tests and check code coverage.
- Use `uvx ruff format` to lint the code before committing.
- Use `uv sync` to re-sync the project dependencies.
- Always use Pydantic types for data validation.
- Always add tests for new features. Run tests during development and before committing.
